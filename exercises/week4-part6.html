Question 1
</br>Phong lighting is lighting equation which calculates specular component of fColor. Phong shading is per pixel lighting where you interpolate normals.
</br> Question 2
</br>Flat Shading: Unrealistic look but easy to compute.
</br>Gouraud Shading: Can't handle specular lights. More realistic look than flat shading. Modest cost for computing.
</br>Phong Shading: The most realistic look also the most expensive to compute. Can handle specular lights.
</br>Question 3
</br>Point Light: Single location in space, for example bulb. Directional Light: Stream of rays, for example the sun.
</br>Question 4
</br>No. Shading is calculated with polygon's vertices or normals.
</br>Question 5
</br>Reflection of polygon decreases.
</br>Question 6
</br>Shininess focuses the light on some point when it is increased.
</br>Question 7
</br>Camera coordinate space.
